## Code of behaviour

Every person at the club must be aware of the code of behaviour and follow these expectations. Our code of behaviour document is available at [rpf.io/code-of-behaviour](http://rpf.io/code-of-behaviour){:target='_blank'}

### Breaking the code of behaviour

If a volunteer in your club behaves inappropriately and/or breaks the code of behaviour, action will have to be taken by the club organiser. If the club organiser breaks the code of behaviour, action will have to be taken by another volunteer.

Actions to take:

* A verbal warning
* A formal written warning, to which any further indiscretions will lead to suspension from the club or to ending their role as a volunteer of the club
* Suspension of the volunteer from the club
* Banning the volunteer from participating in further activities in the club

If you or your club is unsure of the action to take please, ask for support from the <a href="mailto:safeguarding@raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>.

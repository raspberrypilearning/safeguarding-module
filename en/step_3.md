## Induction of new volunteers

When you first meet a volunteer, there will be some induction requirements. This includes recognising the desirable characteristics for volunteers; while a volunteer may not have all these traits, they should definitely have at least one.

### 1. Training identification  

If your volunteers would like some further training or support, you can direct them to the [free online courses](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi){:target='_blank'} that are provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. 

If you have several volunteers in your club, you could also arrange some sessions between yourselves to share knowledge and try out new programmes and projects together. This will help increase the confidence of your volunteers on what they are covering in the club.

### 2. Selection

Does the new volunteer seem like a good fit for your club? Get in touch with them and let them know when your next session is to see if they can attend. If you are just starting your club for the first time, maybe consider having an informal meeting with all your volunteers to create a plan for your first session.
If there are any concerns during the recruitment process of the volunteer, you may want to tell them that they are not a good fit. If you are unsure, you can get in touch with the Raspberry Pi Foundation for advice. 

### 3. First club buddy  

Congratulations! You have successfully recruited a new volunteer for your club. For their first session, remember they will need some help to get started and to get to know the children. If you have several volunteers at your club, try to pair them up with an experienced volunteer. We wouldn’t advise making new volunteers run a session on their first club visit as it may be intimidating to a new joiner. It's a good idea to put volunteers into pairs so they can plan and run the session together and learn from each other.

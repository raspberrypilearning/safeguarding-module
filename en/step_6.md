## Abuse and disclosures

A vast majority of young people take part in our clubs without encountering abuse. However, it is important that volunteers are aware of what to do when they become aware of abuse either through observation or through a child telling you about abuse (disclosure). Most Raspberry Pi Foundation clubs create an environment in which many young people feel particularly comfortable, which can help encourage disclosures at the club.

Child abuse is generally categorised as neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, or radicalisation. Other aspects to be aware of include peer abuse, organised abuse, and online abuse.

### Types of abuse: neglect

Neglect can be defined in terms of an omission, where a child suffers significant harm or impairment of development by being deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, intellectual stimulation, supervision and safety, attachment to and affection from adults, and/or medical care.

### Types of abuse: physical abuse

Physical abuse of a child is that which results in actual or potential physical harm from an interaction, or lack of interaction, which is reasonably within the control of a parent or person in a position of responsibility, power, or trust. There may be single or repeated incidents.  

Physical abuse can involve:

* Severe physical punishment
* Beating, slapping, hitting, or kicking
* Pushing, shaking, or throwing
* Terrorising with threats

### Types of abuse: emotional abuse

Emotional abuse is normally to be found in the relationship between a parent or caregiver and a child rather than in a specific event or pattern of events. It occurs when a child’s needs for affection, approval, consistency, and security are not met. It is rarely manifested in terms of physical symptoms.

For example:

* Persistent criticism
* Sarcasm or hostility
* Emotional unavailability
* Use of unreasonable or harsh disciplinary measures

### Types of abuse: sexual abuse

Sexual abuse occurs when a child is used by another person for his/her gratification or sexual arousal, or for that of others. This doesn't have to be physical contact and it can happen online.
Sometimes the child won't understand that what's happening to them is abuse. They may not even understand that it's wrong.

### Types of abuse: radicalisation

Children at risk of radicalisation may be victims of other forms of abuse, such as bullying or discrimnation, that make them easy targets for extremists.

Radicalisation can be difficult to notice, as it is similar to some normal teenage behaviours. Here are some signs that a person or group might be attempting to radicalise a child or young person:

- The child or young person isolates themselves from family and friends
- The child or young person talks as if from a scripted speech
- The child or young person is unwilling or unable to discuss their views
- The child or young person shows a suddenly disrespectful attitude towards others
- The child or young person has increased levels of anger
- The child or young person is increasingly secretive, especially around internet use

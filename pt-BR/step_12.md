## That’s almost it

You’ve completed this short interactive learning guide. Well done!

You can now test your knowledge with some scenarios. In each scenario, we want you to consider what you definitely would do, what you may do (depending on the circumstances), and what you would not do.

### Kim

**You notice one of the young people at the club, Kim, who is 12 years old, is making a game which focuses on sadness and isolation, and there are some references to suicide. The lead character in the game is also called Kim.**

--- hints --- --- hint ---

In this scenario, you should ensure you check on the young person before you make any assumptions. Kim’s parents or guardians should be informed of the game by the most appropriate person, which may be you, but could be another volunteer or teacher from the club. It may also be relevant to tell the young person's parents or guardians about local support in the area if the volunteer knows what these are; often a general practitioner or local doctor is the best place to initially point a parent or guardian to in this scenario. Most importantly, you should talk to your club organiser, or teacher if in a school setting, and ensure that someone from the club checks on Kim in future sessions.

### Mark

**One of the young people in the club has come to you and told you that Mark, aged 11, is on his laptop and is looking at pictures of people with "no clothes on and doing strange things".**

--- hints --- --- hint ---

The main learning from this scenario is to not overreact or make assumptions, as this could have been something quite innocent or accidental like an advert or pop-up. If the matter can be dealt with immediately, then you (or the club organiser) should speak to Mark without assumptions. Then you (or the club organiser) should speak to both sets of parents (or guardians) separately, mainly to ensure this doesn’t happen again in the club. You should ensure the young person who reported this is OK and knows that you are dealing with the situation. You should make the club organiser aware of the situation and perhaps you may organise an online safety session a few weeks after the incident.

### Zoe

**During an online club session, one of the club members, Zoe, shouts an obscenity at an adult in their home. The adult shouts back. You hear a loud crash, and the club member disappears from your view. You can hear threatening behaviour from the adult and the camera turns off.**

--- hints --- --- hint ---

In this scenario, there is an immediate concern about the welfare of a young person and you have no way of knowing whether the young person is safe. The first thing you need to do is to call the police, who will investigate the incident. The second thing you need to do is call our 24-hour safeguarding number to report what has happened.

### Robert

**During an online session, you notice that Robert, one of the club members, posts sexually explicit language and links to pornographic websites in the comments section.**

--- hints --- --- hint ---

It’s important to make a record of what Robert has posted, in case this happens again. He may not know the significance of what he has posted, so it’s important that you let his parents or guardians know what happened and provide them with the [parents guide](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Parents-guide-to-CoderDojo). Other young people attending the online session may have seen the messages and been affected by them, so it’s important that you contact their parents or guardians as well and let them know what happened and how you intend to follow up.

### Lisa

**Lisa, one of the young people in your club, has got in touch through a private message on social media to ask for help with a project.**

--- hints --- --- hint ---

One-to-one messaging with young people is not encouraged for any volunteers, either on social media or through other mediums (including email). There are some situations that you may want to respond to the young person: if it is a long time until the next session or there is a deadline for the project to be entered in a competition and you do not want to disappoint the young person. If you do respond, you should encourage that they email you and cc their parent or guardian (or the club organiser or teacher) into the conversation in future or regarding this query.
